# Version 1.12.0

* New feature: detect extraneous indexes on PostgreSQL materialized views
  (contributed by fatkodima).
* New feature: support for case-insensitive validations in
  missing_unique_indexes (contributed by fatkodima).
* New feature: support for has_one in missing_unique_indexes (contributed by
  fatkodima).
* New feature: support for async options in incorrect_dependent_option
  (contributed by fatkodima).
* Bug fix: make Rake integration work in non-Rails projects (contributed by
  fatkodima).
* Bug fix: ignore inherited validations in missing_unique_indexes (contributed
  by fatkodima).
* Bug fix: make extraneous_indexes work on expression indexes (contributed
  by fatkodima).
* short_primary_key type checks only integer indexes as they are the ones at the
  risk of running out (contributed by fatkodima).
* unindexed_foreign_keys looks at actual foreign keys, instead of guessing based
  on column name (contributed by fatkodima).
* Improvements and clarifications to documentation and error messages
  (contributed by Kurtis Rainbolt-Greene, Vincent Glennon, and fatkodima).

# Version 1.11.0

* New feature: support for polymorphic associations in
  missing_non_null_constraint (contributed by fatkodima).
* New feature: support for foreign tables in PostgreSQL (contributed by
  fatkodima).
* New feature: debug logging for easier troubleshooting.
* Bug fix: incorrect_length_validation used to take the first length validator
  on the model, even if it didn't correspond to the column under consideration.
  This is no longer the case (contributed by Julián Lires).
* Bug fix: inclusion and exclusion validators can contain a proc in in: or
  within: which makes them impossible to analyze by active_record_doctor; such
  validations are now skipped (contributed by fatkodima).
* Fixed to documentation for incorrect_dependent_option (contributed by
  Erick Santos).
* Bug fix: mismatched_foreign_key_type used to always look at the type of the
  primary key in the other table, even if the foreign key was referencing a
  different column; the right column is now taken into account (contributed by
  Bruno Gerotto).
* Bug fix: incorrect_dependent_option didn't work correctly on through:
  associations as it would look at the final model (instead of the join model);
  additionally, if the join model lacked the corresponding has_many association
  it would result in NoMethodError.

# Version 1.10.0

* New feature: incorrect_length_validation detector can identify text-column
  length mismatches between tables and models (suggested by fatkodima).
* New feature: each detector can be enabled or disabled globally via the
  configuration file.
* Enhancement: missing_non_null_constraints and missing_presence_validation
  recognized NOT NULL check constraints (contributed by fatkodima).
* Enhancement: missing_unique_index is aware of has_one associations and
  recommends creating an index on the corresponding foreign key (contributed by
  fatkodima).
* Bug fix: missing_unique_indexes can be satisfied by creating an index on a
  sublist of scope + column. Previously, it'd not accept such sublists even
  though they're enough to guarantee uniqueness (contributed by fatkodima).
* Bug fix: fix missing_unique_indexes crashes on function indexes (contributed
  by fatkodima).
* Bug fix: short_primary_key_type no longer complains about UUID primary keys
  (contributed by fatkodima).
* Bug fix: extraneous_indexes was made aware of non-standard primary key names
  and partial indexes (contributed by fatkodima).
* Bug fix: extraneous_indexes properly recognizes smaller indexes to be enough
  to guarantee uniqueness. Previously, it'd skip some smaller indexes and ask
  for a larger index to be created (contributed by fatkodima).
* Bug fix: unindexed_deleted_at correctly works on partial indexes intended to
  cover deleted columns. It no longer asks to create a contradictory condition
  (IS NULL AND IS NOT NULL) in those cases (contributed by fatkodima).
* Bug fix: incorrect_dependent_option works correctly on polymorphic
  associations.
* Bug fix: recognize the PostGIS adapter as PostgreSQL (contributed by
  fatkodima).
* Bug fix: index generators use index_name_length (defined by Active Record) to
  ensure index names aren't too long (contributed by fatkodima).
* Tested against Ruby 3.1 via CI (contributed by Peter Goldstein).
* Documentation fixes (contributed by Alistair McKinnell and Kaleb Lape).

# Version 1.9.0

* New feature: support for project-specific configuration and Continuous
  Integration usage.
* New feature: `mismatched_foreign_key_type` can detect foreign keys using a
  different column type than the column they're referencing (contributed by
  fatkodima).
* New feature: `short_primary_key_type` can detect primary keys that use short
  integer types and pose a risk of running out of IDs (contributed by
  fatkodima).
* Enhancement: `missing_non_null_constraint` can now properly handle both STI
  and non-STI inheritance hierarchies (contributed by Greg Navis and fatkodima).
* Enhancement: `incorrect_dependency_option` now supports `belongs_to`
  associations (contributed by fatkodima).
* Enhancement: more built-in Rails tables are ignored by default.
* Bug fix: make `extraneous_indexes` take index options into account when
  comparing them for equivalence (contributed by fatkodima).
* Bug fix: add_indexes_generator uses the correct migration version.
* Bug fix: add_indexes_generattor truncates long index names (contributed by
  Dusan Orlovic).
* Bug fix: `missing_unique_indexes` reports tables instead of indexes - it
  didn't make sense to talk about indexes on _models_.

# Version 1.8.0

* New feature: `incorrect_dependency_option` can detect cases sub-optimal or
  dangerous use of `:delete_all` or `:destroy` on associations (thanks to Dusan
  Orlovic for the contribution).
* New feature: `all` runs all tasks and exits with a zero status if there were
  no errors.
* New feature: support for MySQL!
* Bug fix: `add_index` in Rails 6 now correctly adds version numbers to
  migrations (thanks to Tatsuya Hoshino for the fix).

  missing_presence_validation skip models whose underlying tables don't exist
  (thanks to rhymes for the fix).
* Bug fix: fix a bug in incorrect_boolean_presence_validation that caused
  exceptions (thanks to Eito Katagiri for the fix).
* Bug fix: add a missing dependency on activesupport (thanks to Yuto Ito for
  the fix).
* Bug fix: make missing_unique_indexes work on custom validators (thanks to Max
  Schwenk for the fix).
* Bug fix: make missing_unique_indexes order-independent so that it no longer
  reports false-positives when columns are reordered (thanks to rhymes for the
  fix).

# Version 1.7.1

* Bug fix: fix a bug in missing_non_null_constraint that resulted in false
  positives (thanks to Artem Chubchenko for the fix).

# Version 1.7.0

* New feature: detect incorrect boolean column presence validations (they
  must always use inclusion/exclusion instead of presence validators).
* Bug fix: don't report missing presence validations on boolean columns if
  they're properly validated for inclusion/exclusion.
* Bug fix: don't report missing presence validations if the validation is
  defined on the association instead of the foreign key column.
* Bug fix: report missing non-NULL constraints on foreign keys when the presence
  validation is defined on the association.

  for the fix).
* Enhancement: support view-backed models in undefined_table_references.

  Tom)
